# e-hotels Project

e-Hotels is a collaborative project by five major hotel chains in North America to develop an application that allows customers to book rooms easily and see room availability in real-time. The project requires creating a database to store information about hotel chains, hotels, rooms, customers, and employees.

For the front-end, I utilized the React library to build a responsive user interface with components such as forms, buttons, and modals. I used React Router to handle client-side routing and Redux for state management.

On the back-end, I implemented an API using Next.js to handle requests and responses. I used the API routes feature to define RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations. I also integrated middleware such as Next.js's built-in body-parser to parse request bodies and CORS to enable cross-origin resource sharing.

For the database, I chose MySQL as the relational database management system. I created the database schema using MySQL Workbench and defined tables with appropriate fields, relationships, and constraints. To interact with the database from the API, I utilized the MySQL driver for Node.js and executed SQL queries to perform database operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting records.
